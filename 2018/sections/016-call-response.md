Let us pray.
God the Father,

have mercy upon us.

God the Son,

have mercy upon us.

God the Holy Spirit,

have mercy upon us.

Holy Blessed and glorious Trinity,

have mercy upon us.

From all unrighteousness; from pride,
vanity, and hypocrisy; from envy,
hatred, and malice; and from all
evil desires,

good Lord, deliver us.

From laziness, worldliness, and love of
money; from hardness of heart, and
contempt for your word and
your laws,

good Lord, deliver us.

From sins of body and mind; from the
deceits of the world, the flesh, and
the devil,

good Lord, deliver us.

In all times of sorrow; in all times of
joy; in the hour of death,
and at the day of judgment,

good Lord, deliver us.

By the mystery of your holy
incarnation; by your birth, childhood,
and obedience; by your baptism,
fasting, and temptation,

good Lord, deliver us.

By your ministry in word and work;
by your mighty acts of power; and by
your preaching of the kingdom,

good Lord, deliver us.

By your agony and trial; by your cross
and passion; and by your precious
death and burial,

good Lord, deliver us.

By your mighty resurrection; by your
glorious ascension; and by your
sending of the Holy Spirit,

good Lord, deliver us.

Hear our prayers, O Lord our God.

Hear us, good Lord.

Govern and direct your holy Church;
fill it with love and truth; and grant it
that unity which is your will.

Hear us, good Lord.

Give us boldness to preach the gospel
in all the world, and to make disciples
of all the nations.

Hear us, good Lord.

Enlighten our bishops and all who
minister with knowledge and
understanding, that by their teaching
and their lives they may proclaim
your word.

Hear us, good Lord.

Give your people grace to hear and
receive your word, and to bring forth
the fruit of the Spirit.

Hear us, good Lord.

Bring into the way of truth all who
have erred and are deceived.

Hear us, good Lord.

Strengthen those who stand;
comfort and help the faint-hearted;
raise up the fallen; and finally beat
down Satan under our feet.

Hear us, good Lord.

Guide the leaders of the nations into
the ways of peace and justice.

Hear us, good Lord.

Guard and strengthen our President,
that he may put his trust in you,
and seek your honor and glory.

Hear us, good Lord.

Bless those who administer the law,
that they may uphold justice, honesty
and truth.

Hear us, good Lord.

Help and comfort the lonely, the
bereaved, and the oppressed.

Lord, have mercy.

Heal the sick in body and mind, and
provide for the homeless, the hungry,
the destitute,

Lord, have mercy.

Show your pity on prisoners and
refugees, and all who are in trouble.

Lord, have mercy.

Forgive our enemies, persecutors and
slanderers, and turn their hearts.

Lord, have mercy.

We give thanks for those who have
died in the peace of Christ. Grant us
with them a share in your eternal
kingdom.

Lord, have mercy
