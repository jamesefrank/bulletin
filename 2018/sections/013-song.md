Tough the clouds may hover over
Tere’s a bright and golden ray
It’s the promise that is in heaven
God shall wipe all tears away

When we reach that blessed homeland
where it it everlasting day
Oh, that bright eternal morning
God shall wipe all tears away

No more sorrow, no more weeping
Peace and joy everyday
for beside life’s crystal river
God shall wipe all tears away

Though the clouds may hover over
There’s a bright and golden ray
It’s the promise that is in heaven
God shall wipe all tears away
