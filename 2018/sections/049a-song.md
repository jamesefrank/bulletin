We will feast in the house of Zion,
We will sing with our hearts restored
“He has done great things,” we will say together,
We will feast and weep no more.

We will not be burned by the fire;
He is the Lord our God
We are not consumed by the flood—
Upheld, protected, gathered up

In the dark of night before the dawn
My soul be not afraid;
For the promised morning, Oh how long
O God of Jacob, be my strength!

Every vow we've broken and betrayed,
You are the faithful One;
And from the garden to the grave,
Bind us together, bring shalom.
