Wake up, O daughter of Zion!
Leave here your clothing of shame.
No more the orphan or harlot,
See, I give you a new name!

Take up these garments of splendor;
Beautiful daughter, rise up!
Feel my great mercy surround you;
Dress in the gown of my love.

Glorious there in her chamber
Wearing the robe of the king
See him delight in her beauty
With joy and gladness he sings:

“Beautiful bride,” He has called you;
Sought afer, married, redeemed.
You’ll be the crown of my glory,
You, my most highly esteemed.”
