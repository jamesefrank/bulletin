The Lamb has overcome,
the Lamb has overcome
The battle’s been done
and the victory is won

For the Lamb has overcome
No grave could hold Him down,
 no grave could hold Him down
Up from the ground,
“He is risen!” was the sound
No grave could hold Him down

At God’s right hand is He,
at God’s right hand is He
Our Perfect Plea
as He lives to intercede
At God’s right hand is He

Worthy is the Lamb who was slain,
Glory be unto His name (2x)

The table now is spread,
the table now is spread
This wine and bread,
broken body and blood shed
The table now is spread
