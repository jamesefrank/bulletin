Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies;
Prostrate lying, suff'ring, dying
On the cross, a sacrifice.
Vict'ry gaining, life obtaining,
Now in glory He doth rise!
Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies!

Man's work faileth, Christ's availeth;
He is all our righteousness;
He, our Savior, has forever
Set us free from dire distress.
Through His merit we inherit
Light and peace and happiness!
Man's work faileth, Christ's availeth;
He is all our righteousness.

Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head;
Death no longer is the stronger,
Hell itself is captive led.
Christ has risen from death's prison,
O'er the tomb He light has shed!
Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head!

For His favor, praise forever,
Unto God the Father sing;
Praise the Savior, praise Him ever,
Son of God, our Lord and King.
Praise the Spirit,
through Christ's merit,
He doth us salvation bring!
Praise the Savior now and ever,
Praise Him all, our Lord and King.
