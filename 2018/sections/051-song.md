Thou art King of glory, Christ,
Virgin’s son, God everlasting,
For us sinners sacrificed,
Then from death, the Victor rising.
Death crushed, now the faithful sight
Heaven’s doors flung open wide!

Now thou art on heaven’s throne
At the Father’s right hand seated
Hear us pray Thy kingdom come,
Be on earth Thy will completed.
’Til that day of joy and dread,
where are judged the quick and dead.

Look upon your servants, God,
Show thy mercy, give thy blessing,
We, redeemed by thy dear blood,
Join the Saints thy Love confessing
With them numbered may we be,
Now and through eternity
