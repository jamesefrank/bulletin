To all who are spiritually weary and seek rest; to all who mourn and long for comfort; to all who struggle and desire hope; to all who sin and need a Savior; to all who are strangers and yearn for fellowship; to all who hunger and thirst after righteousness; and to whoever will come; this church opens wide her doors and offers welcome in the name of the risen Lord Jesus Christ.

He is quite dead, and now His body is being removed from the cross for burial. Closely cropped, the picture presents mostly Christâ€™s upper body, although His thigh is visible in the lower center."/>
