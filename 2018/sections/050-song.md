Oh my love you have grown so cold
To the world outside the house next door
She who has been loved so much
 has so much to give
Mercy is the fragrance of the broken

```
Justice will roll down
Justice will roll down
From high upon these mountains with a mighty river’s sound
It will roll down
It will roll down
```

Oh my child I will be your light
In your secret pain in the dark of night
No enemy, no conqueror could steal a life from me
I am your salvation and your victory

Soon, oh soon, when the trumpet sounds
Every knee shall bend, every heart shall bow
I have made a new world where the servant is a king
Oppression will be over when the slave’s set free
