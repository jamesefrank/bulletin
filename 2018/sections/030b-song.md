O, Spirit of God
Speak Your peace
Speak Your peace
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen, amen
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen, amen

Oh merciful God
Forgive us, forgive us
Oh merciful God
Forgive us, forgive us
For all the things
We have done and left undone
For all the things
We have done and left undone

Oh Son of God
Rescue us, rescue us
Oh Son of God
Rescue us, rescue us
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen, amen
Now and at the hour of our death
Amen
