In the fields of the Lord our work is rest
He is moving in our hands and feet to bless
In the fields of the Lord,
in the fields of the Lord
In the fields of the Lord our work is rest

In the vineyards of the Lord our work is light
He is tending every leaf and every vine
In the vineyards of the Lord,
in the vineyards of the Lord
In the vineyards of the Lord our work is light

In the garden of the Lord our work is sound
He is weaving every thorn into a crown
In the garden of the Lord,
in the garden of the Lord
In the garden of the Lord our work is sound

At the harvest of the Lord the felds are white
He will wipe away the tears from evâ€™ry eye
At the harvest of the Lord,
at the harvest of the Lord,
At the harvest of the Lord the fields are white.
