<img src="http://vigil.adventdc.org/2018/ressurection.jpg" alt="Twisting diagonally through the center of the panel, Jesus’ muscular frame is solid, limp, and heavy. His pale skin and dark hair are streaked and matted with blood, a bright stream of which has stained His right side where He was pierced with the spear. Turning to His face, His mouth is open and His eyes are lifeless. As His head falls back, caught between the wood of the beam and His left shoulder, we see the underside of His nose and the bottom edge of His upper teeth. At the top right corner of the picture, His left hand, soaked in scarlet, is still solidly nailed to the rough wood. Behind the body, a bloody white cloth falls down and lays draped over His exposed thigh. At the bottom right, we can see the crown of thorns hanging over the top of an empty ladder. The sponge with which they offered him a drink is raised up on a curved, jointed spike that vaguely resembles the denuded bones of a long finger. The strikingly pale skin of the dead Jesus contrasts starkly with the healthy flesh of the figure on the left. Seen from the back, this person has climbed a ladder and is working, hands and arms overhead. Reaching up beyond the bounds of the panel, he will free Christ’s right hand from the nail"/>
