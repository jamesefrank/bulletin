Let us pray.

O God of unchangeable power and
eternal light: Look favorably on
your whole Church, that wonderful
and sacred mystery; by the effectual
working of your providence, carry
out in tranquility the plan of
salvation; let the whole world see
and know that things which were
cast down are being raised up, and
things which had grown old are
being made new, and that all things
are being brought to their
perfection by him through whom
all things were made, your Son
Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
