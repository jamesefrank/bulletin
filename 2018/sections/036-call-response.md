Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs
of angels, and let your trumpets shout
salvation for the victory of our mighty
King! Rejoice and sing now, all the
earth, bright with a glorious splendor,
for darkness has been vanquished by
our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad
now, Mother Church, and let your
holy courts, in radiant light, resound
with the praises of your people.
The Lord be with you!

And also with you!

Let us give thanks to the Lord our
God!

It is right to give him thanks
and praise!

It is right and a good and joyful thing,
always and everywhere,
With our whole heart and mind and
voice, to praise you,
The invisible, almighty, and eternal
God, through your only-begotten Son,
Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the
true Lamb of God, who at the
Passover feast paid for us the debt of
Adamâ€™s sin, and by his blood delivered
us from death.

Glory to you forever!

This is the night, when you brought
our fathers, the children of Israel, out
of bondage in Egypt, and led them
through the sea on dry land.

Glory to you forever!

This is the night, when Jesus Christ
broke the bonds of death and hell,
And rose victorious from the grave.

Glory to you forever!

This is the night, when all who believe
in him are delivered from the guilt and
power of sin, and restored to grace
and holiness of life.

Glory to you forever!

How wonderful and beyond our
knowing, O God, is your mercy and
loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a
slave, you gave a Son.

Glory to you forever!

How blessed is this night, when earth
and heaven are joined and man is
reconciled to God.

Glory to you forever!

Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our
sacrifice of praise; And grant our
darkness to be light!
For Christ has been raised from
the dead,
The first-fruits of those who have
fallen asleep.
For as by a man came death,
By a man has come also the
resurrection of the dead. For as in
Adam all die,
So also in Christ shall all be
made alive.

Amen.
