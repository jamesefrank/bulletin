Do you renounce the devil and all his
works, the vain pomp and glory of the
world, and the sinful desires of the
flesh so that you will not follow nor be
led by them?

I renounce them all.

Do you believe in God the Father?

I believe in God, the Father
almighty creator of heaven
and earth.

Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son
of God?

I believe in Jesus Christ, his only
Son, our Lord. He was conceived
by the Holy Spirit and born of
the virgin Mary. He suffered
under Pontius Pilate, was
crucified, died, and was buried.
He descended to the dead. On
the third day he rose again. He
ascended into heaven, and is
seated at the right hand of
the Father.

Do you believe in God the Holy
Spirit?

I believe in the Holy Spirit,
the holy catholic Church,
the communion of saints,
the forgiveness of sins,
the resurrection of the body,
and the life everlasting.

Will you continue in the apostles’
teaching and fellowship, in the
breaking of bread, and in the prayers?

I will, with God’s help.

Will you persevere in resisting evil, and
whenever you fall into sin, repent, and
return to the Lord?

I will, with God’s help.

Will you proclaim by word and deed
the Good News of God in Christ?

I will, with God’s help.

Will you seek to love the Lord your
God with all your heart, with all your
soul, and with all your mind; and will
you seek to love your neighbor as
yourself?

I will, with God’s help.
