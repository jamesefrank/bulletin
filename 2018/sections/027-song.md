O sacred head, now wounded,
with grief and shame weighed down;
Now scornfully surrounded
with thorns thine only crown.
O sacred head, what glory,
what bliss till now was Thine!
Yes, though despised and gory,
I joy to call Thee mine.

What Thou, my Lord hast suffered,
was all for sinner’s gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
but Thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior,
’tis I deserve Thy place;
Look on me with Thy favor,
vouchsafe me to Thy grace.

What language shall I borrow,
to thank Thee dearest friend,
For this Thy dying sorry,
Thy pity without end?
O make me Thine forever;
and should I fainting be,
Lord let me never, never
outlive my love to Thee.
