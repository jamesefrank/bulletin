Our mouths they were filled,
filled with laughter
Our tongues they were loosed,
loosed with joy
Restore us, O Lord
Restore us, O Lord

Although we are weeping
Lord, help us keep sowing
The seeds of Your Kingdom
For the day You will reap them

Your sheaves we will carry
Lord, please do not tarry
All those who sow weeping
Will go out with songs of joy

The nations will say,
“He has done great things!”
The nations will sing songs of joy
Restore us, O Lord
Restore us, O Lord
