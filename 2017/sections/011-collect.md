Let us pray.

Almighty God, who brought
Noah and his family to safety
through water: Grant to us who
are born again by water and
the Spirit that we may be
faithful to our calling as your
adopted children through Jesus
Christ who lives and reigns
with you and the Holy Spirit,
one God, now and forever.
Amen.
