Come, Christians, join to sing
Alleluia, Amen!
Loud praise to Christ our King;
Alleluia, Amen!
Let all, with heart and voice,
Before His throne rejoice;
Praise is His gracious choice.
Alleluia, Amen!

Come, fix your eyes on Christ;
Alleluia, Amen!
He's vanquished Death with Life;
Alleluia, Amen!

We've no more fear nor shame,
O'er death and sin He reigns
Join now the loud refrain:
Alleluia, Amen!

Lift high the risen Lord,
Alleluia, Amen!
Death shall have pow'r no more;
Alleluia, Amen!
Jesus our conquering King,
He stands in victory;
Trampling down Death, He sings:
Alleluia, Amen!
