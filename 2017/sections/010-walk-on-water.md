Lord Jesus Christ,
you walk on water
You walk upon the waves
Your Spirit lights our way
And we know love because
you've loved us
You take our fears away
Your Spirit lights our way
You give us grace
although we stumble
We're prone to falter, prone to fail
Oh Holy One you are the victor
You are the anchor
You walk on water

You free the slaves and
through the water
We make a joyful sound
We walk upon dry ground
Into the land that you have promised
The waves come crashing down
You lead us, fire and cloud
And though we wander
through the desert
Our Father’s steadfast love remains
Deliverer, You bring us home, Lord
And where we falter
You walk on water

We follow you into deep waters
Into the death you died
We suffer by your side
You are the Ark,
our Shield, our Savior
Preserve us through the flood
And wash us with your blood
Though we behold the depths in wonder
Trembling, we trust you and obey
The waters deep
Your love is deeper
Your love is broader
You walk on water

You reach your arms into the water
And raise us up to life
Your perfect, spotless bride
We see the dove, we hear the Father
“My dear beloved Son”
You raise us up as one
You make us yours,
your brothers, sisters,
Your fellow heirs;
you've called us friends
And with your life you've paid our ransom
You make us holy
You walk on water
