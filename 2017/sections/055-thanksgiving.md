Mighty God we thank and praise you
For this meal, this Bread of Life;
Precious blood and body, broken,
From your Son our Savior, Christ

In these myst'ries you assure us
We are members of your Son;
Heirs of your eternal Kingdom,
With all faithful people, One.

Humbly now we ask you, Father,
In your grace, to make us strong,
That, with all the saints before us,
In good works we may press on!

Send us out to love and serve you!
Send us out to sing your praise!
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
Pow'r and glory to your name!
Amen! Amen!
