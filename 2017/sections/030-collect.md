Let us pray.

Almighty God, Creator of
heaven and earth: Grant that,
as the crucified body of your
dear Son was laid in the tomb
and rested on this night, so
may we await with him the
coming of the third day, and
rise with him to newness of
life; who lives and reigns with
you and the Holy Spirit, one
God, now and forever.
Amen.
