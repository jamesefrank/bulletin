		<h3>Prelude</h3>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		
		<h3>Introit: Creator of the Stars of Night<span class="presenter">Dana Litke</span></h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics nosinging">
			<p>Creator of the stars of night, your people's everlasting light,<br/>
			O Christ, Redeemer of us all, we pray you hear us when we call.</p>
			<p>In sorrow that the ancient curse should doom to death a universe,<br/>
			You came down, O Savior, to set free your own in glorious liberty!</p>
			<p>When this old world drew on toward night, you came, but not in splendor bright,<br/>
			Not as a great monarch, but the child of Mary, blameless mother mild.</p>
			<p>Come in thy holy might, we pray; redeem us for that boundless day<br/>
			And from every power of darkness, when thou judgest all the sons of men.</p>
			<p>To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
			Laud and honor, might and glory be from age to age eternally!</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Collect for Evening</h3>
		
		<div class="prayer">
			<p>The Lord be with you<br/>
			<span class="response">And also with you.</span>
			Let us pray<br/>
			<span class="response">Lighten our darkness, O Lord, and by your great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers  of this night; for the love of your only Son our Savior Jesus Christ.  Amen.</span></p>
		</div>
		<p>On this night, our Lord Jesus Christ passed over from death to life. The Church invites her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in vigil and prayer, remembering God's great mercy. This is the Passover of the Lord, in which through word and sacrament we share in Jesus' victory over death.</p>

		<h3>Hymn: Psalm 19 &#8211; The Heavens Declare Thy Glory</h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>1. The heavens declare Thy glory,<br/>
			The firmament Thy power;<br/>
			Day unto day their story<br/>
			Repeats from hour to hour;<br/>
			Night unto night replying,<br/>
			Proclaims in every land,<br/>
			O Lord, with voice undying,<br/>
			The wonders of Thy hand.</p>
			
			<p>2. The sun with royal splendor<br/>
			Goes forth to chant Thy praise;<br/>
			And moonbeams soft and tender<br/>
			Their gentler anthem raise;<br/>
			O'er every tribe and nation<br/>
			Their music is out poured,<br/>
			The song of all creation,<br/>
			To Thee, creation's Lord.</p>
			
			<p>3. All heaven on high rejoices<br/>
			To do its Maker's will;<br/>
			The stars with solemn voices<br/>
			Resound Thy praises still;<br/>
			So all that is within me,<br/>
			With all creation, raise<br/>
			One voice of adoration<br/>
			To our Creator's praise!</p>

		<h3>Choral Hymn: Now the Green Blade Riseth</h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics nosinging">
			<p>Now the green blade riseth from the buried grain,<br/>
			Wheat that in dark earth many days has lain;<br/>
			Love lives again, that with the dead has been:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>In the grave they laid him, love whom hate had slain,<br/>
			Thinking that never he would wake again,<br/>
			Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>Forth he came at Easter, like the risen grain,<br/>
			He that for three days in the grave had lain,<br/>
			Quick from the dead my risen Lord is seen:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,<br/>
			Thy touch can call us back to life again,<br/>
			Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
		</div>

			through Jesus Christ who lives and reigns with you<br/>
			and the Holy Spirit, one God, now and forever. Amen.</p>

			<p>1. Long in darkness Israel wandered;<br/>	
			Long in mortal shadows, we<br/>	
			Walked in bondage and self-pity,<br/>	
			Trod in paths of sin and grief.<br/>	
			In the prophets' words He told us,<br/>	
			Long the God of Israel spoke;<br/>	
			He alone in strength would save us<br/>	
			From the hands of all our foes.</p>
			
			<p>2. He shall raise a mighty Savior;<br/>	
			Born of David's lineage, He<br/>	
			Comes in cov'nant love to claim us<br/>	
			From our sins to set us free.<br/>	
			Light to those who dwell in darkness<br/>	
			Life to those from death who flee<br/>	
			Joy unto the earth, and gladness,<br/>	
			To your pathways dawning peace!</p>

			Every valley be exalted!<br/>	
			Every mountain be made plane!<br/>	
			Crooked ways repent and straighten;<br/>	
			All creation bend in praise!</p>

			David's Son and yet his King,<br/>	
			Dawning light of our salvation,<br/>	
			Of your saving pow'r we sing!<br/>	
			Stand, Oh lame, and dance ye broken,<br/>	
			Know the Savior's healing grace;<br/>	
			Come, Oh deaf and hear him singing;<br/>	
			Turn, Oh blind, behold his face!</p>

		<h3>Choral Hymn: My Song is Love Unknown</h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics nosinging">
			<p>My song is love unknown, my Savior's love to me,<br/>
			Love to the loveless shown, that they might lovely be.<br/>
			Oh who am I, that for my sake my Lord should take frail flesh and die?<br/>
			Sometimes they strew His way, and His sweet praises sing,<br/>
			Resounding all the day hosannas to their King,<br/>
			Then "Crucify!" is all their breath and for His death they thirst and cry.<br/>
			Why, what hath my Lord done to cause this rage and spite?<br/>
			He made the lame to walk and gave the blind their sight.<br/>
			What injuries, yet these are why the Lord most high so cruelly dies.<br/>
			Here might I stay and sing, no story so divine;<br/>
			Never was love, dear King, never was grief like Thine.<br/>
			This is my friend, in whose sweet praise I all my days will gladly spend.</p>

			Turn not from his griefs away, Learn of Jesus Christ to pray.</p>
			
			<p>Follow to the judgement hall, view the Lord of life arraigned;<br/>
			O the wormwood and the gall! O the pangs his soul sustained!<br/>
			Shun not suf'ring shame or loss; Learn of him to bear the Cross.</p>

			Mark that miracle of time, God's own Sacrifice complete;<br/>
			It is finished, hear him cry; Learn of Jesus Christ to die.</p>

			When I was sinking down, sinking down,<br/>
			When I was sinking down beneath God's righteous frown,<br/>
			Christ laid aside His crown for my soul, for my soul,<br/>
			Christ laid aside His crown for my soul.</p>

		<div class="prayer">
			<p>It is right and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere,<br/>
			With our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you,<br/>
			The invisible, almighty, and eternal God, through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Lamb of God, who at the Passover feast paid for us the debt of Adam's sin, and by his blood delivered us from death.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the sea on dry land.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>This is the night, when Jesus Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,<br/>
			And rose victorious from the grave.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>This is the night, when all who believe in him are delivered from the guilt and power of sin, and restored to grace and holiness of life.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God.<br/>
			<span class="response">Glory to you forever!</span></p>
			<p>Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our sacrifice of praise;<br/>
			And grant our darkness to be light! For Christ has been raised from the dead,<br/>
			The first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death,<br/>
			By a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,<br/>
			So also in Christ shall all be made alive.<br/>
			<span class="response">Amen.</span></p>

		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>1. And can it be that I should gain<br/>
			An interest in the Savior's blood?<br/>
			Died He for me, who caused His pain—<br/>
			For me, who Him to death pursued?<br/>
			Amazing love! How can  it    be,<br/>
			That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</p>
			
			<p>Refrain:<br/>
			Amazing love! How can it be,<br/>
			That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?</p>
			
			<p>2. He left His Father's throne above<br/>
			So free, so infinite His grace—<br/>
			Emptied Himself of all but love,<br/>
			And bled for Adam's helpless race:<br/>
			'Tis mercy all, immense and free,<br/>
			For O my God, it found out me!</p>
			
			<p>3. Long my imprisoned spirit lay,<br/>
			Fast bound in sin and nature's night;<br/>
			Thine eye diffused a quickening ray—<br/>
			I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;<br/>
			My chains fell off, my heart was free,<br/>
			I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.</p>
			
			<p>4. No condemnation now I dread;<br/>
			Jesus, and all in Him, is mine;<br/>
			Alive in Him, my living Head,<br/>
			And clothed in righteousness divine,<br/>
			Bold I approach th'eternal throne,<br/>
			And claim the crown, through Christ my own.</p>

		<h3>Prayer of Consecration</h3>
		
		<p>All glory be to you, Almighty God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for in your infinite love, you made us for yourself, crowning us with glory and honor to rule over the works of your hands. Yet we did not give thanks to you or honor you as God but turned away. Falling into sin, we, and all your works, became subject to misery and death.</p>
		
		<p>But you, in your tender mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
		
		<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself there, in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world, once and for all. He died in our place, making a full atonement for our sins. And, by your mighty power, you raised him from death and crowned him with great honor at your right hand on high.</p>
		
		<p>Hear us, merciful Father, and by the power of your Holy Spirit, grant that we who eat this bread and drink this wine, in accordance with our Lord's command, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood.</p>
		
		<p>On the night he was betrayed, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat: This is my Body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</p>
		
		<p>In the same way, after supper he took the cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</p>
		
		<p>Therefore, we proclaim the mystery of faith:<br/>
		<span class="response">Christ has died!<br/>
		Christ is risen!<br/>
		Christ will come again!</span></p>
		
		<p>We celebrate this covenant with joy, and await the glorious appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who will unite all things in heaven and on earth – raising us from death and making all things new. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and forever.  Amen.</p>
		
		<p>The gifts of God for the people of God.<br/>
		Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you,<br/>
		and feed on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving.</p>

		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>1. Amazing grace! How sweet the sound <br/>
			That saved a wretch like me! <br/>
			I once was lost, but now am found; <br/>
			Was blind, but now I see. </p>
			
			<p>2. 'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, <br/>

			How precious did that grace appear <br/>
			The hour I first believed. </p>
			
			<p>3. Through many dangers, toils, and snares <br/>

		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>1. In Christ alone my hope is found;<br/>

			What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br/>
			When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br/>
			My comforter, my all in all—<br/>
			Here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>

			Fullness of God in helpless babe!<br/>
			This gift of love and righteousness,<br/>
			Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br/>
			Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br/>
			The wrath of God was satisfied;<br/>
			For ev&#8217;ry sin on Him was laid—<br/>
			Here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
			
			<p>3. There in the ground His body lay,<br/>
			Light of the world by darkness slain;<br/>
			Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br/>
			Up from the grave He rose again!<br/>
			And as He stands in victory,<br/>
			Sin&#8217;s curse has lost its grip on me;<br/>
			For I am His and He is mine—<br/>
			Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
			
			<p>4. No guilt in life, no fear in death—<br/>
			This is the pow&#8217;r of Christ in me;<br/>
			From life&#8217;s first cry to final breath,<br/>
			Jesus commands my destiny.<br/>
			No pow&#8217;r of hell, no scheme of man,<br/>
			Can ever pluck me from His hand;<br/>
			Till He returns or calls me home—<br/>
			Here in the pow&#8217;r of Christ I&#8217;ll stand.</p>
