		<h1>The Easter Vigil</h1>
		<!--<h2>Opening</h2>-->
		<h3>Prelude</h3>
		<h3>Welcome</h3>
		
		<h3>Introit: Creator of the Stars of Night<span class="presenter">Dana Litke</span></h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics nosinging">
			<p>Creator of the stars of night, your people's everlasting light,<br/>
			O Christ, Redeemer of us all, we pray you hear us when we call.</p>
			<p>In sorrow that the ancient curse should doom to death a universe,<br/>
			You came down, O Savior, to set free your own in glorious liberty!</p>
			<p>When this old world drew on toward night, you came, but not in splendor bright,<br/>
			Not as a great monarch, but the child of Mary, blameless mother mild.</p>
			<p>Come in thy holy might, we pray; redeem us for that boundless day<br/>
			And from every power of darkness, when thou judgest all the sons of men.</p>
			<p>To God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit, Three in One,<br/>
			Laud and honor, might and glory be from age to age eternally!</p>
		</div>
		
		<h3>Collect for Evening</h3>
		
		<div class="prayer clearfix">
			<p>The Lord be with you<br/>
			<span class="response">And also with you.</span><br/>
			Let us pray<br/>
			<span class="response">Lighten our darkness, O Lord, and by your great mercy defend us from all perils and dangers  of this night; for the love of your only Son our Savior Jesus Christ.  Amen.</span></p>
		</div>
		<p>On this night, our Lord Jesus Christ passed over from death to life. The Church invites her members, dispersed throughout the world, to gather in vigil and prayer, remembering God's great mercy. This is the Passover of the Lord, in which through word and sacrament we share in Jesus' victory over death.</p>

			Night unto night replying,<br/>
			Proclaims in every land,<br/>
			O Lord, with voice undying,<br/>
			The wonders of Thy hand.</p>
			
			<p>2. The sun with royal splendor<br/>
			Goes forth to chant Thy praise;<br/>
			And moonbeams soft and tender<br/>
			Their gentler anthem raise;<br/>
			O'er every tribe and nation<br/>
			Their music is out poured,<br/>
			The song of all creation,<br/>
			To Thee, creation's Lord.</p>

			Resound Thy praises still;<br/>
			So all that is within me,<br/>
			With all creation, raise<br/>
			One voice of adoration<br/>
			To our Creator's praise!</p>

			<p>Now the green blade riseth from the buried grain,<br/>
			Wheat that in dark earth many days has lain;<br/>
			Love lives again, that with the dead has been:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>In the grave they laid him, love whom hate had slain,<br/>
			Thinking that never he would wake again,<br/>
			Laid in the earth like grain that sleeps unseen:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>Forth he came at Easter, like the risen grain,<br/>
			He that for three days in the grave had lain,<br/>
			Quick from the dead my risen Lord is seen:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>
			
			<p>When our hearts are wintry, grieving, or in pain,<br/>
			Thy touch can call us back to life again,<br/>
			Fields of our hearts that dead and bare have been:<br/>
			Love is come again like wheat that springeth green.</p>

		<p>Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels, and let your trumpets shout salvation for the victory of our mighty King! Rejoice and sing now, all the earth,</p>
		
		<p>bright with a glorious splendor, for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church, and let your holy courts, in radiant light, resound with the praises of your people.</p>
		
		
		
		<p>The Lord be with you!</p>
		
		<p><b>And also with you!</b></p>
		
		<p>Let us give thanks to the Lord our God!</p>
		
		<p><b>            It is right to give him thanks and praise!</b></p>
		
		
		
		<p>It is right and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere,</p>
		
		<p>With our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you,</p>
		
		<p>The invisible, almighty, and eternal God, through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Lamb of God, who at the Passover feast paid for us the debt of Adam's sin, and by his blood delivered us from death.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the sea on dry land.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>This is the night, when Jesus Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,</p>
		
		<p>And rose victorious from the grave.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>This is the night, when all who believe in him are delivered from the guilt and power of sin, and restored to grace and holiness of life.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God.</p>
		
		<p><b>Glory to you forever!</b></p>
		
		<p>Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our sacrifice of praise;</p>
		
		<p>And grant our darkness to be light! For Christ has been raised from the dead,</p>
		
		<p>The first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death,</p>
		
		<p>By a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,</p>
		
		<p>So also in Christ shall all be made alive.</p>
		
		<p><b>Amen.</b></p>

		<p>In baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death and raised with him to newness of life. We are set free in the Spirit to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. As God's children who he has raised to life, I ask you to renew the promises and vows of your baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve Christ faithfully in his body, the Church.</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
		<p>Do you renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, and the sinful desires of the flesh so that you will not follow nor be led by them?</p>

		<p>Prayer of Consecration</p>
		
		
		
		<p>All glory be to you, Almighty God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for in your infinite love, you made us for yourself, crowning us with glory and honor to rule over the works of your hands. Yet we did not give thanks to you or honor you as God but turned away. Falling into sin, we, and all your works, became subject to misery and death.</p>
		
		<p>But you, in your tender mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.</p>
		
		<p>He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself there, in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world, once and for all. He died in our place, making a full atonement for our sins. And, by your mighty power, you raised him from death and crowned him with great honor at your right hand on high.</p>
		
		<p>Hear us, merciful Father, and by the power of your Holy Spirit, grant that we who eat this bread and drink this wine, in accordance with our Lord's command, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood.</p>
		
		<p>On the night he was betrayed, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, "Take, eat: This is my Body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me."</p>
		
		<p>In the same way, after supper he took the cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, "Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins.  Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me."</p>
		
		<p>Therefore, we proclaim the mystery of faith:</p>
		
		<p><b>Christ has died!</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Christ is risen!</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Christ will come again!</b></p>
		
		<p>We celebrate this covenant with joy, and await the glorious appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who will unite all things in heaven and on earth – raising us from death and making all things new. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and forever.  Amen.</p>
		
		
		
		<p>The gifts of God for the people of God.</p>
		
		<p>Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you,</p>
		
		<p>and feed on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving.</p>

		<p><b>Till on that cross as Jesus died,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>The wrath of God was satisfied;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>For ev&#8217;ry sin on Him was laid—</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Here in the death of Christ I live.</b></p>
		
		<p><b> </b></p>
		
		<p><b>3. There in the ground His body lay,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Light of the world by darkness slain;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Then bursting forth in glorious day,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Up from the grave He rose again!</b></p>
		
		<p><b>And as He stands in victory,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Sin&#8217;s curse has lost its grip on me;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>For I am His and He is mine—</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</b></p>
		
		<p><b> </b></p>
		
		<p><b>4. No guilt in life, no fear in death—</b></p>
		
		<p><b>This is the pow&#8217;r of Christ in me;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>From life&#8217;s first cry to final breath,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Jesus commands my destiny.</b></p>
		
		<p><b>No pow&#8217;r of hell, no scheme of man,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Can ever pluck me from His hand;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Till He returns or calls me home—</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Here in the pow&#8217;r of Christ I&#8217;ll stand.</b></p>
		
		
		
		<p>Crown Him with Many Crowns</p>
		
		<p><b>1. Crown Him with many crowns,</b></p>
		
		<p><b> The Lamb upon His throne</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns</b></p>
		
		<p><b>All music but its own</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Awake my soul and sing</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Of Him who died for Thee</b></p>
		
		<p><b>And hail Him as Thy matchless King</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Through all eternity.</b></p>
		
		<p><b> </b></p>
		
		<p><b>2. Crown Him the Lord of love, </b></p>
		
		<p><b>Behold His hands and side</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Rich wounds yet visible above</b></p>
		
		<p><b>In beauty glorified</b></p>
		
		<p><b>No angel in the sky</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Can fully bear that sight</b></p>
		
		<p><b>But downward bends his burning eye</b></p>
		
		<p><b>At mysteries so bright.</b></p>
		
		<p><b> </b></p>
		
		<p><b>3. Crown Him the Lord of years, </b></p>
		
		<p><b>The Potentate of time,</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Creator of the rolling spheres, </b></p>
		
		<p><b>Ineffably sublime.  </b></p>
		
		<p><b>All hail, Redeemer, hail! </b></p>
		
		<p><b>For Thou has died for me;</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Thy praise shall never, never fail </b></p>
		
		<p><b>Throughout eternity.</b></p>
		
		<p><b> </b></p>
		
		<p><b>4. Crown Him the Lord of life</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Who triumphed o'er the grave</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Who rose victorious in the strife</b></p>
		
		<p><b>For those He came to save</b></p>
		
		<p><b>His glories now we sing</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Who died and rose on high</b></p>
		
		<p><b>Who died eternal life to bring</b></p>
		
		<p><b>And lives that death may die</b></p>
