		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>When your people were bound in oppression<br/>
			And your children were slaves in the land<br/>
			When they cried to their Father in anguish<br/>
			You came with salvation in hand</p>
			
			<p><em>Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit<br/>
			Will you come and deliver again<br/>
			Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit,<br/>
			Will you come and give life again</em></p>
			
			<p>In the pillar of clouds you led them<br/>
			Through a wasteland of desert by night<br/>
			When your children cried out in their hunger<br/>
			You opened the sky to give life</p>
			
			<p>When the prophets of Baal gathered round him<br/>
			And Elijah called to you alone<br/>
			You did not leave him helpless to wonder<br/>
			You sent fire to make yourself known</p>
			
			<p>In the dark of the tomb he was buried<br/>
			A Savior whose followers fled<br/>
			But their sin and their doubt<br/>
			could not speak a sound<br/>
			As loud as His triumph over death!</p>
			
			<p>Age to age you have answered your people<br/>
			With awesome displays of your might<br/>
			Now we call on the same Holy Spirit<br/>
			Give power to be salt and light</p>

			<p>Let the weak say, &#8220;I am strong.&#8221;<br/>
			Let the poor say, &#8220;I am rich.&#8221;<br/>

		<h3>Hymn: Amazing Grace</h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>Amazing grace! How sweet the sound <br/>
			That saved a wretch like me! <br/>
			I once was lost, but now am found; <br/>
			Was blind, but now I see. </p>
			
			<p>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, <br/>
			And grace my fears relieved; <br/>
			How precious did that grace appear <br/>
			The hour I first believed. </p>
			
			<p>Through many dangers, toils, and snares <br/>
			I have already come; <br/>
			'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far, <br/>
			And grace will lead me home. </p>
			
			<p>And when this flesh and heart shall fail, <br/>
			And mortal life shall cease, <br/>
			I shall possess, within the veil, <br/>
			A life of joy and peace. </p>
			
			<p>When we've been there ten thousand years, <br/>
			Bright shining as the sun, <br/>
			We've no less days to sing God's praise <br/>
			Than when we first begun.</p>

		<h3>Hymn: In Christ Alone</h3>
		
		<div class="lyrics">
			<p>In Christ alone my hope is found;<br/>
			He is my light, my strength, my song;<br/>
			This cornerstone, this solid ground,<br/>
			Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br/>
			What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br/>
			When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br/>
			My comforter, my all in all—<br/>
			Here in the love of Christ I stand.</p>
			
			<p>In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,<br/>
			Fullness of God in helpless babe!<br/>
			This gift of love and righteousness,<br/>
			Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br/>
			Till on that cross as Jesus died,<br/>
			The wrath of God was satisfied;<br/>
			For ev&#8217;ry sin on Him was laid—<br/>
			Here in the death of Christ I live.</p>
			
			<p>There in the ground His body lay,<br/>
			Light of the world by darkness slain;<br/>
			Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br/>
			Up from the grave He rose again!<br/>
			And as He stands in victory,<br/>
			Sin&#8217;s curse has lost its grip on me;<br/>
			For I am His and He is mine—<br/>
			Bought with the precious blood of Christ.</p>
			
			<p>No guilt in life, no fear in death—<br/>
			This is the pow&#8217;r of Christ in me;<br/>
			From life&#8217;s first cry to final breath,<br/>
			Jesus commands my destiny.<br/>
			No pow&#8217;r of hell, no scheme of man,<br/>
			Can ever pluck me from His hand;<br/>
			Till He returns or calls me home—<br/>
			Here in the pow&#8217;r of Christ I&#8217;ll stand.</p>

			<p>Crown Him with many crowns,<br/>
			 The Lamb upon His throne<br/>

			All music but its own<br/>
			Awake my soul and sing<br/>
			Of Him who died for Thee<br/>
			And hail Him as Thy matchless King<br/>
			Through all eternity.</p>
			
			<p>Crown Him the Lord of love, <br/>
			Behold His hands and side<br/>
			Rich wounds yet visible above<br/>
			In beauty glorified<br/>
			No angel in the sky<br/>
			Can fully bear that sight<br/>
			But downward bends his burning eye<br/>
			At mysteries so bright.</p>
			
			<p>Crown Him the Lord of years, <br/>
			The Potentate of time,<br/>
			Creator of the rolling spheres, <br/>
			Ineffably sublime.  <br/>
			All hail, Redeemer, hail! <br/>
			For Thou has died for me;<br/>
			Thy praise shall never, never fail <br/>
			Throughout eternity.</p>
			
			<p>Crown Him the Lord of life<br/>
			Who triumphed o'er the grave<br/>
			Who rose victorious in the strife<br/>
			For those He came to save<br/>
			His glories now we sing<br/>
			Who died and rose on high<br/>
			Who died eternal life to bring<br/>
			And lives that death may die</p>
