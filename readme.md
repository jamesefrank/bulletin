`Holy God we Praise thy Name, Part 1 (Te Deum)`

Holy God, we praise Thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee! All on earth Thy scepter claim, All in Heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.

 Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord: 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.  

Lo! the apostolic train Join the sacred name to hallow;
Prophets swell the loud refrain,
And the white robed martyrs follow; And from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.

Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.

`Come, thou long expected Jesus`

Come, Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Israel’s strength and consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

Joy to those who long to see thee,
Dayspring from on high, appear;
come, thou promised Rod of Jesse,
of thy birth we long to hear!
O’er the hills the angels singing news,
glad tidings of a birth;
“Go to him, your praises bringing;
Christ the Lord has come to earth.

Come to earth to taste our sadness,
he whose glories knew no end;
by his life he brings us gladness,
our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.
Leaving riches without number,
born within a cattle stall;
this the everlasting wonder,
Christ was born the Lord of all.

Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a king,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

`Dawning Light of our salvation`

Long in darkness Israel wandered; 
Long in mortal shadows, we 
Walked in bondage and self-pity, 
Trod in paths of sin and grief. 
In the prophets’ words He told us, 
Long the God of Israel spoke; 
He alone in strength would save us 
From the hands of all our foes.

He shall raise a mighty Savior; 
Born of David’s lineage, He
Comes in cov’nant love to claim us
From our sins to set us free.
Light to those who dwell in darkness
Life to those from death who flee
Joy unto the earth, and gladness, 
To your pathways dawning peace!

 Every valley be exalted! 
Every mountain be made plane!
 Crooked ways repent and straighten; 
All creation bend in praise!

Jesus, Lord, and mighty Savior,
David’s Son and yet his King, 
Dawning light of our salvation,
 Of your saving pow’r we sing! 
Stand, Oh lame, and dance ye broken,
Know the Savior’s healing grace;
 Come, Oh deaf and hear him singing; 
Turn, Oh blind, behold his face!

`O Sacred head now wounded`

O sacred head, now wounded,
With grief and shame weighed down,
Now scornfully surrounded
With thorns, Thine only crown;
O sacred head, what glory!
What bliss, till now was Thine!
Yet, though despised and gory,
I joy to call Thee mine.

What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered,
Was all for sinners’ gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
’Tis I deserve Thy place;
Look on me with Thy favor,
Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

What language shall I borrow,
To thank Thee, dearest friend,
For this, Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Oh! make me Thine forever,
And should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to Thee.

## Hymn
`O the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus`

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free! 
Rolling as a mighty ocean 
In its fullness over me! 
Underneath me, all around me, 
Is the current of Thy love 
Leading onward, leading homeward 
To Thy glorious rest above! 

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Spread His praise from shore to shore! 
How He loveth, ever loveth, 
Changeth never, nevermore! 
How He watches o’er His loved ones, 
Died to call them all His own; 
How for them He intercedeth, 
Watcheth o’er them from the throne! 

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Love of every love the best! 
’Tis an ocean vast of blessing, 
’Tis a haven sweet of rest! 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
’Tis a heaven of heavens to me; 
And it lifts me up to glory, 
For it lifts me up to Thee!

## The Exsultet

Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels, and let your trumpets shout salvation for the victory of our mighty King! Rejoice and sing now, all the earth, bright with a glorious splendor, for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church, and let your holy courts, in radiant light, resound with the praises of your people.

The Lord be with you!
**And also with you!**

Let us give thanks to the Lord our God!
**It is right to give him thanks and praise!**

It is right and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere, with our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible, almighty, and eternal God, through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Lamb of God, who at the Passover feast paid for us the debt of Adam's sin, and by his blood delivered us from death.
**Glory to you forever!**

This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the sea on dry land.
**Glory to you forever!**

This is the night, when Jesus Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave.
**Glory to you forever!**

This is the night, when all who believe in him are delivered from the guilt and power of sin, and restored to grace and holiness of life.
**Glory to you forever!**

How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son.
**Glory to you forever!**

How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God.
**Glory to you forever!**

Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our sacrifice of praise; And grant our darkness to be light! For Christ has been raised from the dead,the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
**Amen.**

`Praise the Savior Now and Ever`

On the cross, a sacrifice.
Vict'ry gaining, life obtaining,
Now in glory He doth rise!
Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies!

Man's work faileth, Christ's availeth;

Set us free from dire distress.
Through His merit we inherit

He is all our righteousness.

Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head;
Death no longer is the stronger,
Hell itself is captive led.
Christ has risen from death's prison,
O'er the tomb He light has shed!
Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head!

For His favor, praise forever,
Unto God the Father sing;
Praise the Savior, praise Him ever,
Son of God, our Lord and King.
Praise the Spirit, through Christ's merit,
He doth us salvation bring!
Praise the Savior now and ever,
Praise Him all, our Lord and King.

##Hymn
`Almighty God To you All Hearts Are Open`

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
Search and know our thoughts and anxious fears
Wash us in the fountain of Your mercy
Come with Your light we cannot hide from You

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
With gratitude we raise our song to You
Come and fill the praises of Your people
In grace and truth You make us new again

Hallelujah

No shallow spring will ever satisfy us
But Your river deep floods over everything

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
You take away our sickness and our sin
Oh Lamb of God we gather at Your table
In bread and wine You have supplied our needs

## The Affirmation of Faith
*Please extinguish your candles.*

In baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death and raised with him to newness of life. We are set free in the Spirit to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. As God’s children who he has raised to life, I ask you to renew the promises and vows of your baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve Christ faithfully in his body, the Church.

Do you renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, and the sinful desires of the flesh so that you will not follow nor be led by them?
**I renounce them all.**

Do you believe in God the Father?
  **I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.**

Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God?
**I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father.**

Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?
**I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.**

Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
**I will, with God’s help.**

Will you persevere in resisting evil, and whenever you fall into sin, repent, and return to the Lord?
**I will, with God’s help.**

Will you proclaim by word and deed the Good News of God in Christ?
**I will, with God’s help.**

Will you seek to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and will you seek to love your neighbor as yourself?
**I will, with God’s help.**

May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit,
granting us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal life by his grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

## Passing the Peace

The peace of the Lord be always with you!
**And also with you!**

## Doxology

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise him, all creatures here below;
Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

## Hymn
`Amazing grace`

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

And when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

## Hymn
`What the Lord Has Done In Me`

Let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Let the blind say I can see
It's what the Lord has done in me

Hosanna hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain
Hosanna hosanna
Jesus died and rose again

Into the river I will wade
There my sins are washed away
From the heaven's mercy stream
Of the Savior's love for me

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God
I will sing salvation songs
Jesus Christ has set me free

##Hymn
`Crown Him With Many Crowns`

Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for Thee
And hail Him as Thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of love,
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight
But downward bends his burning eye
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
Who rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

## Hymn
`Holy God, We Praise Thy Name (Part II) (Te Deum)`

Thou art King of glory, Christ, 
Virgin’s son, God everlasting, 
For us sinners sacrificed, 
Then from death, the Victor rising.

 Heaven’s doors flung open wide!
 
Now thou art on heaven’s throne, 
At the Father’s right hand seated. 
Hear us pray Thy kingdom come, 
Be on earth Thy will completed. 
‘Til that day of joy and dread, 
when are judged the quick and dead.

Show thy mercy, give thy blessing.
 We, redeemed by thy dear blood, 
Join the Saints thy Love confessing. 
With them numbered may we be, 
Now and through eternity.
