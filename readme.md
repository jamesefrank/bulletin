Holy God, we praise Thy name;
Lord of all, we bow before Thee! All on earth Thy scepter claim, All in Heaven above adore Thee;
Infinite Thy vast domain,
Everlasting is Thy reign.

 Hark! the loud celestial hymn
Angel choirs above are raising,
Cherubim and seraphim,
In unceasing chorus praising;
Fill the heavens with sweet accord: 
Holy, holy, holy, Lord.  

Lo! the apostolic train Join the sacred name to hallow;
Prophets swell the loud refrain,
And the white robed martyrs follow; And from morn to set of sun,
Through the Church the song goes on.

Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
While in essence only One,
Undivided God we claim Thee;
And adoring bend the knee,
While we own the mystery.

Come, Thou long expected Jesus
Born to set Thy people free;
From our fears and sins release us,
Let us find our rest in Thee.
Israel’s strength and consolation,
Hope of all the earth Thou art;
Dear desire of every nation,
Joy of every longing heart.

Joy to those who long to see thee,
Dayspring from on high, appear;
come, thou promised Rod of Jesse,
of thy birth we long to hear!
O’er the hills the angels singing news,
glad tidings of a birth;
“Go to him, your praises bringing;
Christ the Lord has come to earth.

Come to earth to taste our sadness,
he whose glories knew no end;
by his life he brings us gladness,
our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.
Leaving riches without number,
born within a cattle stall;
this the everlasting wonder,
Christ was born the Lord of all.

Born Thy people to deliver,
Born a child and yet a king,
Born to reign in us forever,
Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
By Thine own eternal Spirit
Rule in all our hearts alone;
By Thine all sufficient merit,
Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

The nations will say, “He has done great things!” The nations will sing songs of joy Restore us, O Lord Restore us, O Lord



Leanne – Narrator: In the fullness of time, God remembered his holy covenant and sent his Son into the world as a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Israel.


The Appearing of God’s Son - A.J.

Gospel Lesson               John 1:1-14

Before and after the lesson, we say:

  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
  For he has visited and redeemed his people
    and raised up a horn of salvation for us
    in the house of his servant David.
            Luke 1:68-69

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness, to bear witness about the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light.

The true light, which gives light to everyone, was coming into the world. He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him. He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him. But to all who did receive him, who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.

And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Before and after the lesson, we say:

  Blessed be the Lord God of Israel,
  For he has visited and redeemed his people
    and raised up a horn of salvation for us
    in the house of his servant David.
            Luke 1:68-69
Note: SH then leads the following.

Collect

  Let us pray.

Father in heaven, who at the baptism of Jesus in the River Jordan proclaimed him your beloved Son and anointed him with the Holy Spirit: Grant that all who are baptized into his Name may keep the covenant they have made, and boldly confess him as Lord and Savior; who with you and the Holy Spirit lives and reigns, one God, in glory everlasting. Amen.

Leanne – Narrator: Through his baptism and endurance in the wilderness, Jesus began his public ministry. He ‘went throughout all Galilee, teaching and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people.’

The Coming of the Kingdom - Diana

Gospel Lesson                Mark 1:9-28
Before and after the lesson, we say:

  For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
  The afflicted who have no one to help.
    He will take pity on the weak and the needy,
    And save the needy from death.
            Psalm 72:12-13

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”

The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel.”

Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. And Jesus said to them, “Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” And immediately they left their nets and followed him. And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him.
And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, “What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God.” But Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!” And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.” And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.

Before and after the lesson, we say:

  For he will deliver the needy who cry out,
  The afflicted who have no one to help.
    He will take pity on the weak and the needy,
    And save the needy from death.
            Psalm 72:12-13


Hymn: Dawning Light of our salvation *

Text: Wendell Kimbrough; music: Bruce Benedict  © 2012
From Luke 1:68-79, & 3:4-6. CCL #  3185445


Long in darkness Israel wandered; Long in mortal shadows, we Walked in bondage and self-pity, Trod in paths of sin and grief. In the prophets’ words He told us, Long the God of Israel spoke; He alone in strength would save us From the hands of all our foes.

He shall raise a mighty Savior; Born of David’s lineage, He
Comes in cov’nant love to claim us
From our sins to set us free.
Light to those who dwell in darkness
Life to those from death who flee
Joy unto the earth, and gladness, To your pathways dawning peace!
 Every valley be exalted! Every mountain be made plane! Crooked ways repent and straighten; All creation bend in praise!

Jesus, Lord, and mighty Savior,
David’s Son and yet his King, Dawning light of our salvation, Of your saving pow’r we sing! Stand, Oh lame, and dance ye broken,
Know the Savior’s healing grace; Come, Oh deaf and hear him singing; Turn, Oh blind, behold his face!


Leanne – Narrator: Though the people of Israel saw the power of God’s kingdom, they did not perceive the truth. Though they heard Jesus’ teaching, they did not understand. Their hearts were hardened and they plotted against Jesus to put him to death.

The Death & Burial of Jesus - Casey

Gospel Lesson
                             Mark 15:21-47
Before and after the lesson, we say:

  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
    Why are you so far from saving me,
    from the words of my groaning?
            Psalm 22:1

And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull).  And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. And it was the third hour when they crucified him. 

And the inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.” And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself, and come down from the cross!” So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself. Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.

And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?” And some of the bystanders hearing it said, “Behold, he is calling Elijah.” And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.” And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was the Son of God!”

There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.

And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  

Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb.  Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.

Before and after the lesson, we say:

  My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?
    Why are you so far from saving me,
    from the words of my groaning?
            Psalm 22:1

Hymn: “O Sacred head now wounded”*

Text: Bernard of Clairvaux, 1153, tr. James W. Alexander, 1830; Music: Passion Chorale by Hans Hessler, 1601, harmonized by  J.S. Bach, 1729.

O sacred head, now wounded,
With grief and shame weighed down,
Now scornfully surrounded
With thorns, Thine only crown;
O sacred head, what glory!
What bliss, till now was Thine!
Yet, though despised and gory,
I joy to call Thee mine.

What Thou, my Lord, hast suffered,
Was all for sinners’ gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But Thine the deadly pain.
Lo, here I fall, my Savior!
’Tis I deserve Thy place;
Look on me with Thy favor,
Vouchsafe to me Thy grace.

What language shall I borrow,
To thank Thee, dearest friend,
For this, Thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
Oh! make me Thine forever,
And should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to Thee.

Homily — Tommy

Note: All but TH, Recess out of the sanctuary after the hymn with the painting of Jesus. Lights are dim. TH leads the following collect:

  Let us pray.

Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth: Grant that, as the crucified body of your dear Son was laid in the tomb and rested on this night,
so may we await with him the coming of the third day, and rise with him to newness of life; who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit,
  one God, now and forever. Amen.

Hymn: “O the Deep, Deep Love of Jesus”*

Text:  Samuel Trevor Francis.  Music:  Welsh melody
(adapt. Thomas John Williams)

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free! 
Rolling as a mighty ocean 
In its fullness over me! 
Underneath me, all around me, 
Is the current of Thy love 
Leading onward, leading homeward 
To Thy glorious rest above! 

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Spread His praise from shore to shore! 
How He loveth, ever loveth, 
Changeth never, nevermore! 
How He watches o’er His loved ones, 
Died to call them all His own; 
How for them He intercedeth, 
Watcheth o’er them from the throne! 

O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
Love of every love the best! 
’Tis an ocean vast of blessing, 
’Tis a haven sweet of rest! 
O the deep, deep love of Jesus, 
’Tis a heaven of heavens to me; 
And it lifts me up to glory, 
For it lifts me up to Thee!


The Resurrection of Our Lord

Gospel Lesson*                     Mark 16:1-8
  Before the lesson, we say:

  This is the holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ according to St. Mark.
    Glory to you, Lord Christ!

  After the lesson, we say:

  The holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ!
    Praise to you, Lord Christ!

  Note: After the response to the Gospel Lesson, the congregation may be seated, and music will softly play while the Gospel  processional re-gathers on the platform. WP steps forward to the lectern for the Exsultet to begin immediately after the instrumental   music ends.

The Exsultet

Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels, and let your trumpets shout salvation for the victory of our mighty King! Rejoice and sing now, all the earth,
bright with a glorious splendor, for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church, and let your holy courts, in radiant light, resound with the praises of your people.

The Lord be with you!
  And also with you!
  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God!
  It is right to give him thanks and praise!
It is right and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere,
With our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you,
The invisible, almighty, and eternal God, through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Lamb of God, who at the Passover feast paid for us the debt of Adam’s sin, and by his blood delivered us from death.
  Glory to you forever!
This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the sea on dry land.
  Glory to you forever!
This is the night, when Jesus Christ broke the bonds of death and hell,
And rose victorious from the grave.
  Glory to you forever!
This is the night, when all who believe in him are delivered from the guilt and power of sin, and restored to grace and holiness of life.
  Glory to you forever!
How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son.
        Glory to you forever!
How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God.
    Glory to you forever!
Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our sacrifice of praise;
And grant our darkness to be light! For Christ has been raised from the dead,
The first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death,
By a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die,
So also in Christ shall all be made alive.
  Amen.

“Praise the Savior Now and Ever”

Words: Venantius Fortunatus, ca. 530-609; Tr. by Augustus Nelson, 1863-1949; alt Kimbrough 2012.  HOLY MANNA Attr. to William Moore, 1825; Arr. Benedict/Bradham, 2005 ©2006 Cardiphonia Music

Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies;
Prostrate lying, suff'ring, dying
On the cross, a sacrifice.
Vict'ry gaining, life obtaining,
Now in glory He doth rise!
Praise the Savior now and ever;
Praise Him, all beneath the skies!

Man's work faileth, Christ's availeth;
He is all our righteousness;
He, our Savior, has forever
Set us free from dire distress.
Through His merit we inherit
Light and peace and happiness!
Man's work faileth, Christ's availeth;
He is all our righteousness.


Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head;
Death no longer is the stronger,
Hell itself is captive led.
Christ has risen from death's prison,
O'er the tomb He light has shed!
Sin's bonds severed, we're delivered,
Christ has bruised the serpent's head!

For His favor, praise forever,
Unto God the Father sing;
Praise the Savior, praise Him ever,
Son of God, our Lord and King.
Praise the Spirit, through Christ's merit,
He doth us salvation bring!
Praise the Savior now and ever,
Praise Him all, our Lord and King.

“Almighty God To you All Hearts Are Open”

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
Search and know our thoughts and anxious fears
Wash us in the fountain of Your mercy
Come with Your light we cannot hide from You

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
With gratitude we raise our song to You
Come and fill the praises of Your people
In grace and truth You make us new again

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
We long for more than what this world provides
No shallow spring will ever satisfy us
But Your river deep floods over everything

Almighty God to You all hearts are open
You take away our sickness and our sin
Oh Lamb of God we gather at Your table
In bread and wine You have supplied our needs





The Affirmation of our Faith

  Note: Before beginning the Affirmation of Faith, DM tells everyone to put out candles and remain standing for the affirmation of  faith. Then, DM begins this section with the following:

In baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death and raised with him to newness of life. We are set free in the Spirit to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. As God’s children who he has raised to life, I ask you to renew the promises and vows of your baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve Christ faithfully in his body, the Church.

  Note: DM leads us through this section.

Do you renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, and the sinful desires of the flesh so that you will not follow nor be led by them?
  I renounce them all.
Do you believe in God the Father?
  I believe in God, the Father almighty,
  creator of heaven and earth.
Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God?
  I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord.
  He was conceived by the Holy Spirit
  and born of the virgin Mary.
  He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
  Was crucified, died, and was buried.
  He descended to the dead.
  On the third day he rose again.
  He ascended into heaven,
  and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit?
  I believe in the Holy Spirit,
  the holy catholic Church,
  the communion of saints,
  the forgiveness of sins,
  the resurrection of the body,
  and the life everlasting.
Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers?
  I will, with God’s help.
Will you persevere in resisting evil, and whenever you fall into sin, repent, and return to the Lord?
  I will, with God’s help.
Will you proclaim by word and deed the Good News of God in Christ?
  I will, with God’s help.
Will you seek to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and will you seek to love your neighbor as yourself?
  I will, with God’s help.
May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit,
granting us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal life by his grace,
in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen.

  Note: After the affirmation, DC leads the peace and Eucharist, and notes that prayer ministers will be in the foyer, and upstairs in the  balcony.

The Lord’s Table

Passing the Peace

  The peace of the Lord be always with you!
    And also with you!
  Greet one another in the peace of Christ.

Note: Musicians begin Doxology after a few minutes of the peace.

 “Doxology”

Praise God, from whom all blessings flow;
Praise him, all creatures here below;
Praise him above, ye heavenly host;
Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Amen.

Invitation to the Table

Great Thanksgiving

 Lord be with you!
    And also with you!
  Lift up your hearts!
    We lift them up to the Lord!
  Let us give thanks to the Lord our God!
    It is right to give him thanks and praise!

It is right, and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere to give thanks to you Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth. Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power!  But chiefly we praise you for the glorious resurrection of your Son Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Paschal Lamb, who was sacrificed for us, and has taken away the sin of the world.

By his death he has destroyed death, and by his rising to life again He has won for us everlasting life. Therefore, we praise you, joining our voices with angels and archangels and with all the company of heaven who forever sing this hymn to proclaim the glory of your name:
“SANCTUS”

Holy, holy, holy Lord
God of power and might
Heaven and earth are
Full of your glory (repeat)

Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest

Blessed is He who comes
In the name of the Lord

Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest
Hosanna, Hosanna
In the highest

Prayer of Consecration

All glory be to you, Almighty God: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; for in your infinite love, you made us for yourself, crowning us with glory and honor to rule over the works of your hands. Yet we did not give thanks to you or honor you as God but turned away. Falling into sin, we, and all your works, became subject to misery and death.

But you, in your tender mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.

He stretched out his arms upon the cross, and offered himself there, in obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world, once and for all. He died in our place, making a full atonement for our sins. And, by your mighty power, you raised him from death and crowned him with great honor at your right hand on high.

Hear us, merciful Father, and by the power of your Holy Spirit, grant that we who eat this bread and drink this wine, in accordance with our Lord’s command, in remembrance of his death and passion, may be partakers of his most blessed body and blood.

On the night he was betrayed, our Lord Jesus Christ took bread; and when he had given thanks to you, he broke it, and gave it to his disciples, saying, “Take, eat: This is my Body which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”


In the same way, after supper he took the cup; and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, “Drink this, all of you: This is my Blood of the New Covenant, which is poured out for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins. Do this, whenever you drink it, in remembrance of me.”

Therefore, we proclaim the mystery of faith:
Christ has died!
Christ is risen!
Christ will come again!

We celebrate this covenant with joy, and await the glorious appearing of our Savior, Jesus Christ, who will unite all things in heaven and on earth – raising us from death and making all things new. By him, and with him, and in him, in the unity of the Holy Spirit all honor and glory is yours, Almighty Father, now and forever. Amen.

The gifts of God for the people of God.
Take them in remembrance that Christ died for you,
and feed on him in your hearts by faith with thanksgiving.

“AMAZING GRACE”

Words: John Newton & John Reese (v5); Music: American Folk Tune

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares
I have already come;
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

And when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.

“What the Lord Has Done In Me”

Reuben Morgan. © 1998 Hillsong Music Publishing (Admin. by Capitol CMG Publishing). CCL #  3185445

Let the weak say I am strong
Let the poor say I am rich
Let the blind say I can see
It's what the Lord has done in me

Hosanna hosanna
To the Lamb that was slain
Hosanna hosanna
Jesus died and rose again




Into the river I will wade
There my sins are washed away
From the heaven's mercy stream
Of the Savior's love for me

I will rise from waters deep
Into the saving arms of God
I will sing salvation songs
Jesus Christ has set me free

“Crown Him With Many Crowns”

Words: Matthew Bridges, 1852, 1874. Music: George Elvey, 1868


Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne
Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns
All music but its own
Awake my soul and sing
Of Him who died for Thee
And hail Him as Thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of love,
Behold His hands and side
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight
But downward bends his burning eye
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou has died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o'er the grave
Who rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die


“Holy God, We Praise Thy Name (Part II)” (Te Deum)

Words: based on Te Deum, ca. 4th c., attr. to Ignace Franz, ca. 1774, tr. by Daniel Beilman, 2014. Music: Katholisches Gesangbuch, Vienna, ca. 1774

Thou art King of glory, Christ, Virgin’s son, God everlasting, For us sinners sacrificed, Then from death, the Victor rising. Death crushed, now the faithful sight Heaven’s doors flung open wide!
  Now thou art on heaven’s throne, At the Father’s right hand seated. Hear us pray Thy kingdom come, Be on earth Thy will completed. ‘Til that day of joy and dread, when are judged the quick and dead.  Look upon your servants, God, Show thy mercy, give thy blessing. We, redeemed by thy dear blood, Join the Saints thy Love confessing. With them numbered may we be, Now and through eternity.

prayer of thanksgiving

Words: Wendell Kimbrough, 2012, based on the Book of Common Prayer; Music: Ludwig van Beethoven, 1824.

With all faithful people, One.

Humbly now we ask you, Father,
In your grace, to make us strong,

In good works we may press on!

Pow'r and glory to your name!
Amen! Amen!
