<h3>Hymn: Holy God we Praise thy Name, Part 1 (Te Deum)</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
	<p>
	Holy God, we praise Thy name;
	Lord of all, we bow before Thee! All on earth Thy scepter claim, All in Heaven above adore Thee;
	Infinite Thy vast domain,
	Everlasting is Thy reign.

  	Hark! the loud celestial hymn
	Angel choirs above are raising,
	Cherubim and seraphim,
	In unceasing chorus praising;
	Fill the heavens with sweet accord: 
	Holy, holy, holy, Lord.  

	Lo! the apostolic train Join the sacred name to hallow;
	Prophets swell the loud refrain,
	And the white robed martyrs follow; And from morn to set of sun,
	Through the Church the song goes on.

	Holy Father, Holy Son, Holy Spirit, Three we name Thee;
	While in essence only One,
	Undivided God we claim Thee;
	And adoring bend the knee,
	While we own the mystery.

	O’er the hills the angels singing news,
	glad tidings of a birth;
	“Go to him, your praises bringing;
	Christ the Lord has come to earth.

	Come to earth to taste our sadness,
	he whose glories knew no end;
	by his life he brings us gladness,
	our Redeemer, Shepherd, Friend.
	Leaving riches without number,
	born within a cattle stall;
	this the everlasting wonder,
	Christ was born the Lord of all.

	Born Thy people to deliver,
	Born a child and yet a king,
	Born to reign in us forever,
	Now Thy gracious kingdom bring.
	By Thine own eternal Spirit
	Rule in all our hearts alone;
	By Thine all sufficient merit,
	Raise us to Thy glorious throne.

		In the prophets’ words He told us,  <br />

		Born of David’s lineage, He <br />

		Life to those from death who flee <br />
		Joy unto the earth, and gladness,  <br />
		To your pathways dawning peace! <br />

	<p>
	The holy gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ!
	<span class='response'>Praise to you, Lord Christ!</span>

</div>

<h3>The Exsultet</h3>

<div class="prayer">
	<p>
	Rejoice now, heavenly hosts and choirs of angels, and let your trumpets shout salvation for the victory of our mighty King! Rejoice and sing now, all the earth, bright with a glorious splendor, for darkness has been vanquished by our eternal King. Rejoice and be glad now, Mother Church, and let your holy courts, in radiant light, resound with the praises of your people. <br />
	The Lord be with you! <br />
	<span class='response'>And also with you!</span> <br />
	Let us give thanks to the Lord our God! <br />
	<span class='response'>It is right to give him thanks and praise!</span> <br />
	It is right and a good and joyful thing, always and everywhere, with our whole heart and mind and voice, to praise you, the invisible, almighty, and eternal God, through your only-begotten Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; for he is the true Lamb of God, who at the Passover feast paid for us the debt of Adam's sin, and by his blood delivered us from death. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	This is the night, when you brought our fathers, the children of Israel, out of bondage in Egypt, and led them through the sea on dry land. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	This is the night, when Jesus Christ broke the bonds of death and hell, and rose victorious from the grave. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	This is the night, when all who believe in him are delivered from the guilt and power of sin, and restored to grace and holiness of life. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	How wonderful and beyond our knowing, O God, is your mercy and loving-kindness to us, that to redeem a slave, you gave a Son. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	How blessed is this night, when earth and heaven are joined and man is reconciled to God. <br />
	<span class='response'>Glory to you forever!</span> <br />
	Therefore, heavenly Father, accept our sacrifice of praise; And grant our darkness to be light! For Christ has been raised from the dead,the first-fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. <br />

<div class="prayer">
	<p>
	In baptism, we are buried with Christ in his death and raised with him to newness of life. We are set free in the Spirit to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness. As God’s children who he has raised to life, I ask you to renew the promises and vows of your baptism, by which we once renounced Satan and all his works, and promised to serve Christ faithfully in his body, the Church. <br/>
	Do you renounce the devil and all his works, the vain pomp and glory of the world, and the sinful desires of the flesh so that you will not follow nor be led by them? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I renounce them all.</span> <br/>
	Do you believe in God the Father? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I believe in God, the Father almighty, creator of heaven and earth</span> <br/>
	Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son, our Lord. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the virgin Mary. He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended to the dead. On the third day he rose again. He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</span> <br/>
	Do you believe in God the Holy Spirit? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic Church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.</span> <br/>
	Will you continue in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in the prayers? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I will, with God’s help.</span> <br/>
	Will you persevere in resisting evil, and whenever you fall into sin, repent, and return to the Lord? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I will, with God’s help.</span> <br/>
	Will you proclaim by word and deed the Good News of God in Christ? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I will, with God’s help.</span> <br/>
	Will you seek to love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind; and will you seek to love your neighbor as yourself? <br/>
	<span class='response'>I will, with God’s help.</span> <br/>
	May Almighty God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has given us new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, granting us the forgiveness of sins, keep us in eternal life by his grace, in Christ Jesus our Lord. Amen. <br/>

<h3>Hymn: Amazing grace</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
	<p>
	Amazing grace! How sweet the sound <br />
	That saved a wretch like me! <br />
	I once was lost, but now am found; <br />
	Was blind, but now I see. <br />
</p><p>
	'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear, <br />
	And grace my fears relieved; <br />
	How precious did that grace appear <br />
	The hour I first believed. <br />
</p><p>
	Through many dangers, toils, and snares <br />
	I have already come; <br />
	'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far, <br />
	And grace will lead me home. <br />
</p><p>
	And when this flesh and heart shall fail, <br />
	And mortal life shall cease, <br />
	I shall possess, within the veil, <br />
	A life of joy and peace. <br />
</p><p>
	When we've been there ten thousand years, <br />
	Bright shining as the sun, <br />
	We've no less days to sing God's praise <br />
	Than when we first begun. <br />

<h3>Hymn: What the Lord Has Done In Me</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
	<p>
	Let the weak say I am strong <br />
	Let the poor say I am rich <br />
	Let the blind say I can see <br />
	It's what the Lord has done in me <br />
</p><p>
	Hosanna hosanna <br />
	To the Lamb that was slain <br />
	Hosanna hosanna <br />
	Jesus died and rose again <br />
</p><p>
	Into the river I will wade <br />
	There my sins are washed away <br />
	From the heaven's mercy stream <br />
	Of the Savior's love for me <br />
</p><p>
	I will rise from waters deep <br />
	Into the saving arms of God <br />
	I will sing salvation songs <br />
	Jesus Christ has set me free <br />

<h3>Hymn: Crown Him With Many Crowns</h3>

<div class="lyrics">
	<p>
	Crown Him with many crowns, <br />
	The Lamb upon His throne <br />
	Hark how the heavenly anthem drowns <br />
	All music but its own <br />
	Awake my soul and sing <br />
	Of Him who died for Thee <br />
	And hail Him as Thy matchless King <br />
	Through all eternity. <br />
</p><p>
	Crown Him the Lord of love, <br />
	Behold His hands and side <br />
	Rich wounds yet visible above <br />
	In beauty glorified <br />
	No angel in the sky <br />
	Can fully bear that sight <br />
	But downward bends his burning eye <br />
	At mysteries so bright. <br />
</p><p>
	Crown Him the Lord of years, <br />
	The Potentate of time, <br />
	Creator of the rolling spheres, <br />
	Ineffably sublime. <br />
	All hail, Redeemer, hail! <br />
	For Thou has died for me; <br />
	Thy praise shall never, never fail <br />
	Throughout eternity. <br />
</p><p>
	Crown Him the Lord of life <br />
	Who triumphed o'er the grave <br />
	Who rose victorious in the strife <br />
	For those He came to save <br />
	His glories now we sing <br />
	Who died and rose on high <br />
	Who died eternal life to bring <br />
	And lives that death may die <br />
